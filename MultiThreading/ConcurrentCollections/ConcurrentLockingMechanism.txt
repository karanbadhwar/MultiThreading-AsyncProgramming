`ConcurrentQueue<T>` **does not use a traditional `lock` keyword** like `lock(obj)` internally, but it **is still thread-safe**. Let me clarify how it works:

---

### **How `ConcurrentQueue<T>` Works Internally**

* `ConcurrentQueue<T>` is part of `System.Collections.Concurrent`.
* It uses a **lock-free algorithm** based on **linked segments and atomic operations**.
* It relies on **Interlocked operations (Compare-And-Exchange, CAS)** to safely update pointers.
* This means:

  * Multiple threads can enqueue and dequeue concurrently without blocking each other most of the time.
  * There is no explicit `lock` (`Monitor.Enter`) that serializes access.
  * Instead, it uses **spin-waiting** and atomic pointer changes to maintain thread safety.

---

### **Enqueue and Dequeue Safety**

* **Enqueue:** Adds to the tail segment using atomic writes.
* **Dequeue (TryDequeue):** Removes from the head segment using atomic reads/writes.
* **Count:** Is only an **approximation**, because while you read it, other threads can be modifying the queue.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* **No, `Enqueue` does not use a `lock`** in the sense of `lock(obj)`; it uses lock-free concurrency.
* The thread safety comes from **atomic operations**, not blocking locks.
* That's why `ConcurrentQueue` is **fast and scalable** for producer-consumer scenarios.
